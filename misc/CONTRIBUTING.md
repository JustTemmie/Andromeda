# Contributing

This is for code contributions. For translations, see [TRANSLATING](../assets/language_data/README.md).

# Basic Guidelines

## Use an IDE.
I recommend VS Code, but anything works

## Always test your changes.
Do not submit something without at least running the bot to double check that it starts up.
If you are submitting a new command, make sure it's name, brief, and potentially description can be found in the en-GB translation file, and make sure that the command(s) function correctly. if you're changing existing commands, test them out.

## Do not make large changes before discussing them first.
If you're considering adding a significant feature or making substantial code changes, please reach out to me on Discord, or create an issue on the repo. For most modifications, this isn't required. However, for major changes, Iâ€™d like to provide guidance and ensure your efforts are well-directed.

## Do not make formatting PRs.
Yes, there are some trailing spaces, extra newlines, empty indents, and other minor errors. However, I can't be fucked merging, viewing, or be notified about a 1-line PR just to fix these. If you're working on a PR that modifies actual code, feel free to correct formatting around your changes, but please avoid making insignificant changes that waste everyone's time.

# Other Notes
If you'd like to have your name credited within the bot, add your name to the [contributor list](../assets/text/contributors.txt) as part of your PR.
