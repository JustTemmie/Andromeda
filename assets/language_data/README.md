TODO

in general, all messages should be kept lowercase - with the exception of embeds, where the main and sub titles should be written in [AP Stylebook Title Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case#AP_Stylebook)

don't touch the translation keys, even if they have typos in them - they won't be shown to the user anyways so it's more bother than it's worth

if a translation value for a given key isn't found, or a command fails to fetch a user's locale, it will default to the key found in en-GB (i REFUSE to color so it'll be the only properly up-to-date one)
